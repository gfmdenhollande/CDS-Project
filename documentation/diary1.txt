Week 1
The first week we got an introduction to the course and the software we are going to use. 
This encompassed an introduction to computational design, procedural design and Houdini.
On Wednesday we went on a field trip to the site location in Rotterdam to, among other things, 
get a feeling for scale, typology, surroundings, possibilities, etc.

On Thursday we worked on the program of requirements and had our first consultations. For the PoR
we used the design brief, but we also used our self-defined design principles with relation to
extra functions, relations between the different occupants, and collective space. We created a
network diagram based on the functions in our building.

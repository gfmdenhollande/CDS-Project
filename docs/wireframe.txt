WIREFRAME
Start: point cloud with seeded points

Find all points within a radius that's as big as the voxelwidth and store the points in a list. Remove the first point in the list, since this is the point itself. Create a line from the point to all neighbours in the list. 

---
Loop:
For all points:
Create a list with the vertices that belong to that point
If there are less than three vertices:
	Create a list that contains all primitives connected to the point
	Remove the primitives
---

Fuse everything
Go into the growth model

SEED ALLOCATION
Start: weighted voxelpoints:

Create attribute groundfl and set value to -1 for all points
Set value to 1 if the y-coordinate is 1.5

Loop as many times as there are functions:
Sort the wp values, starting with wp0
Run over all points:
	Keep count and store in a detail attribute. 
	Stop the script when it finds an onoccupied point on the groundfloor
	
The counter is now the same as the pointnumber that is the best available point on the groundfloor
Set this point as a parent
